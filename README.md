# üé¨ Project: Netflix-GPT

## üìò Overview

A modern streaming web app combining a Netflix-style interface with AI-powered movie recommendations. Built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with **Firebase** for authentication and APIs from **TMDB** and **OpenAI (Groq)** for intelligent movie suggestions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Login/Sign-up:** Secure authentication via **Firebase**.
2. **Browse Movies:** Dynamic UI with trailers and categorized lists fetched from **TMDB API**.
3. **AI Search:** Users enter natural language queries (e.g., ‚Äúbest sci-fi films from the 90s‚Äù).
4. **AI Recommendations:** **Groq API** processes the query and returns matching titles; detailed info fetched from TMDB.
5. **Session Security:** Authenticated routes protect user data and redirect on logout or expiry.
